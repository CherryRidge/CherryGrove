A highly customizable scripting-based block game framework made for the next generation.

## Goals

1. None of actual gameplay content is built-in, so basically every aspect of gameplay is changeable.
2. Highly customizable via JSON or JavaScript. Most of the gameplay definitions can be changed dynamically.
   - Also, it's not difficult to develop your own modding API in C++.
3. High performance due to V8 engine and various intrinsic components that can be quickly accessed by packs.
4. Integrate camera presets and offline-rendering to provide tools for animation creation.
5. Abilities and plans to support various platforms: Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, iOS, Web (emscripten).
6. Completely free and open source, licensed under [GPL-3.0-or-later](LICENSE).
